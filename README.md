###### Description

This is a repo for the **SpeechBubble** platform.
Speech Bubble is a platform where my friend [Petar](https://github.com/petarstojkovski1) and I, keep track of our comic book collections and leave reviews of the comics we have read. All geeks are welcome to join in on the discussion.

Platform was built on with **React** and **Firebase**
Some of the features use **Imgur API** and **Disqus API**

**STACK:**

- React
- Firebase
- Imgur Api
- Disqus Api

------

###### Inspiration

When I realized I couldn't keep track of my comic books anymore, I started working on a platform that would help me in both keeping track of what I own or have read as well as what my thoughts on the comic were. Then [Petar](https://github.com/petarstojkovski1) also a major geek was kind enough to devote his time to work on this project with me.
It is our little geek heaven!
